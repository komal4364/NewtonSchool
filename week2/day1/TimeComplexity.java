Programming: Tools
Resources: Storage and Compute
Eg: Phone Storage(RAM, SD), Compute(Processor)

When should we worry about these resources?
- large input that doesn't fit in memory?
- instructions that take lot of time

Programs that takes long time to run or more storage are least preferrable.
How do we measure/represent the resource utilization for a given program/algorithm?
- can we capture the amount of bytes used and amout of time it took to run a program?
- we need a way to generalize the concept of resource utilization.

What is the varying/changing in a given program/algorithm that affects the resources
utilization?
- input size

A valid algorithm that solves the given problem using less resources is considered 
as an optimal algorithm.

Let's say, T(n) defines the time complexity of an algorithm
Eg: 
- T(n) = n^3 + n^2 + n + 1; 
- T(n) = 2^n + n^3 + n + 1;
- T(n) = nlog2n + n;

eg: Sum of n natural numbers;
sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    sum = sum + i; // this statement is executed n time?;
the compute cost to run sum = sum + i is let's say C (some constant);
The algorithm cost of summing n numbers is "nc" i.e T(n) = cn;

The algorithm response to an input of size n is denoted as Order of Growth and represented 
as O(n); where is termed as Big-O and n is the input size.

Big O Notation expresses the run time of an algorithm in terms of how quickly it grows relative to 
the input ‘n’ by defining the N number of operations that are done on it. 
Thus, the time complexity of an algorithm is denoted by the combination of all O[n] assigned 
for each line of function.

Prominent Time Complexities: (order of desired to worst)
Constant - O(1)
Log: O(log n)
Linear - O(n)
LinearArithmic - O(n log n) //sorting algorithms
Quadratic: O(n^2)
Cubic: O(n^3)
Exponential: O(c^n) - finding all subsets
Factorial: O(n!) - finding all permutations of a given set/string;
