**Collections**
A group of individual objects grouped together is a collection.

**Collection Framework**
In Java, along with collections, a collection framework was introduced. This framework then takes several classes, interfaces and represents them as a single unit. Hence, it combines the collections so that they can be manipulated and worked on together. These are found in the java.util package.

**The collections framework**
<p>The framework consists of three categories of collections:</p>

1. Collection classes: These include different type of classes that can be used as they are or used to enhance and create a customized class.

2. Collection interfaces: This is the part of the framework that represents a collection i.e. it provides different type of interfaces for the collections and relevant methods that can be used by a collection.

3. Collection algorithms: This consists of several algorithms that a collection can use on the collection classes.

Letâ€™s look at the different objects and methods available in each category in the illustration below.
